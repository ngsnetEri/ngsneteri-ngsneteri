#  Git Command Practice

This section is for documenting clean and structured commit examples I use to improve consistency across my cybersecurity and development projects.  

###  Example Commit Commands
```bash
git commit -m "docs: update README with example usage"
git commit -m "feat: add small Python port scanner script"
git commit -m "fix: correct socket timeout handling"
